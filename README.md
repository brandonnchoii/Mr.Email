# Mr.Email
First use of Python. <br><br>

Basic software to correctly produce Duke email addresses from names &amp; id's. Spent a few hours of the day creating this. While the program doesn't do anything complex, it was interesting to learn and try out a new language for the day. Any confusing syntax should be explained in the comments.<br><br>

Included in this repo: python code, practice text file, resulting text file<br><br>

TODO: add script to automate mail app and insert recipient list.
